# procinfo

A Ruby/C extension packaged as a gem that provides a more uniform interface
to \*NIX process information.

## Motivation

I really needed to be able to get current RSS and max RSS information (and
related process information) for a given process (which may or may not be
the current running process). No Ruby library (as far as I found offered a
consistent view of this information across the most \*NIX OSes).

## Related Works

`sys-proctable` is Ruby/C extension library that provides this to some
degree. I wanted to use a different approach to this library and lower
overhead, and compatibility of APIs exposed for all the supporting OSes.

However, the above mentioned library may offer what you need.
